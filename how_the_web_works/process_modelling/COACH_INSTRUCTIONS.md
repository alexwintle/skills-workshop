# Process modelling (HTTP request/response cycle) (1 hour)

I recommend encouraging them to use https://makers-cats.herokuapp.com/  with chrome dev tools to focus their investigation.

Feel free to extend: https://github.com/makersacademy/process_modelling

## Learning Objective

A process model is a diagram/performance/[something else] that demonstrates how a process works.  In this workshop, you'll practice your process modelling skill by modelling the HTTP request/response cycle.

## Starter (15 minutes)

* Explain the learning objective to the students.

* Do thumbs on the learning objective.

* Talk through the README with the students up to and including the instructions section.

* Demonstrate modelling the [process for visiting the home page](README.md#home-page) of the `https://makers-cats.herokuapp.com/` website.

## Main (50 minutes)

* Ask who wants to model their process as a performance.  Put them into groups of four.

* Ask who wants to model their process on paper.  Suggest they form into pairs.

* Ask who wants to model their process in another way.  Put them into the appropriate groups.

* Set the students going on modelling the [processes to model](README.md#processes-to-model).

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* Do thumbs on the learning objective.

* Ask what insights the students had about the request/response cycle.

* Ask what GET requests are for and what POST requests are for.

* Ask what the components of a GET request are.  Ask what the components of a POST request are.

* Ask about the advantages and disadvantages of the ways the students chose to model the request/response process.
