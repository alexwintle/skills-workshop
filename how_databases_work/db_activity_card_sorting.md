# Database activity

## Goal:

Get an idea of whether devs understand databases on a basic level.
Help them build a solid mental model of what a database looks like.

## Material:

The activity uses 4 sets of cards (could be post-its). Each has a different colour for better visualisation.

### Set 1: Keywords
- database
- table
- row
- column
- query

### Set 2: Verbs
- is made up of
- is made up of
- operates on
- is an attribute of

### Set 3: Library analogy
- A Library
- Books
- Title
- Author
- A book
- Reading all the books by Roald Dahl
- Adding 3 books to the inventory

### Set 4: Menu analogy
- A restaurant menu
- The desserts
- Price
- Tiramisu (a dessert)
- Removing an item from the menu because it's sold out
- Looking at all the vegan desserts


## Running the activity

Going from dev to dev, either talking to a dev alone or in pairs.

I ask them questions following this sequence.

#### 1 - How confident are you that you could describe what a database is?
#### 2 - Show the *keywords*.
Can you describe a database using these keywords?
#### 3 - If they are struggling, show the *verbs*.
Can you use the verbs to describe relations between these words? You can reorganise the words on the table.

At this point, I would give feedback if they are not sure. Some have different ways of conceptualising columns (do they make up tables, or are they just attributes of things inside tables?). That's fine.

#### 4 - Show one of the analogy decks.
Here is an analogy. Look at all these cards, and place each of them next what they would be in that analogy.

Most devs start placing the right card next to database, in which case I would say something like "OK, so if a Library was a database, what would a book be?".
#### 5 - Give them feedback and repeat with the other deck.
If they are in pairs, I would sometimes give one analogy to each, and then ask them to give feedback to the other person, but I like the first method more as it gives them two full cycle of "try, feedback, try again".

#### 6 - Clarify concepts that seem less understood.
Rows and columns can easily be confused. I like to introduce a new analogy there:
- If a table is a ruby class, what is a column? what is a row? (instance variables and instance of a class)
- If a table is empty, how many rows does it have? How many columns?

#### 7 - Show a last card with 4 words on it:
 - IDs
 - CRUD
 - SQL
 - Record

Do you know what each of these words would mean in the context of databases?

Each gives me an opportunity to go deeper:

- *IDs :* Why would you use them? In the context of the Library, what would be IDs useful for? (several copies of the same book)
- *CRUD :* What are the different types of queries? Can you classify the queries for the library? (Reading books = read, adding them = create). Can you imagine queries for U and D in the library analogy?
- *SQL :* What it means, different pronunciations, the different between the language and the database systems based on it.
- *Record:* Introduce them to several different words to talk about data (rows, records, entries, items..)
