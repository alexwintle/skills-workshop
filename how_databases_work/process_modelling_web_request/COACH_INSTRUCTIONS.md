# Modelling a web request from browser to db and back again

### Learning objectives

1) Remember that a model, view, controller (MVC) is a pattern for making websites
2) Understand how information is sent between each component when a browser makes a request

## Instructions

### Equipment needed
- Sheets of A4 paper
- Sharpies
- Post-its

### Starter (15 minutes)

* Show the diagram of MVC. Have a discussion about each thing the diagram shows
* Ask for 5 volunteers from the cohort to act out a scenario. Assign roles for browser, controller, model, view and database 
to volunteers and add this as a name badge. In front of the rest of the cohort act out one of the 
scenarios below by passing a post-it note with the request and data being made to each component. 

This should be specific about how each component queries another component and what  
information is passed at each stage. 

For example for a create operation:

 - Browser sends an HTTP POST request with form fields to the Controller
 - Controller calls Model method with arguments
 - Model performs SQL query on database


### Main (40 minutes)

* Ask the students to get into groups and act out the scenarios in the document

### Plenary (10 minutes)

Come together and ask everyone to draw a process model of MVC. 

AND/OR Suggest this follow on activity

Clone and run [this project](https://github.com/makersacademy/mvc-example)
There are puts statements describing how information is passed between each component.

Look at the code responsible for adding a new book into the database. 
Add a puts statement at each stage of the request between model, view, controller
and database.
