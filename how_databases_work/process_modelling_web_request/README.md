# Modelling a web request from browser to db and back again

## Learning objectives

1) Remember that a model, view, controller (MVC) is a pattern for making websites
2) Understand how information is sent between each component when a browser makes a request

This is a diagram showing a very common way to structure web applications.

What are each of the components on this diagram?

What is the responsibility of the:
- client?
- controller?
- model?
- view?
- database?

## Modelling a request

Get into groups of 5 and assign each person a role of either browser, controller, model, view or database.

Each group needs a sharpie and a sheet of paper. Trace the flow of a request by passing the sheet of paper to 
the relevant person when making a request and add on to the sheet the information you are sending.

### Scenario 1

### Scenario 3

The user has already reached the homepage and this shows a form to log in. This user has already signed up for Twitter.
