# Following the Ajax request/response cycle

## Instructions

### High level goal for the week

At a high level, this week is about building the skills that let you learn a new language and its patterns.  In this workshop, you'll practice following the flow of control to understand the callbacks JavaScript pattern.

### Learning objectives

* Follow the Ajax request/response cycle in a piece of code.

### Following the flow of control

* Look at the code in `index.html` and google anything you don't understand or recognise.

* Once you feel you understand what is happening in `index.html`, open `comparison-with-non-jquery.html` and google anything you don't understand or recognise. 

Option 1:

* We're going to act out the request/response cycle for this code.

* Each part (browser, Heroku server etc.) will be played by a person.

* We'll try and build a detailed picture of the order things happen in, and the information that is sent back and forth.

Option 2: 

* Do a diagram of option 1.

* See if you can change the code to make `comparison-with-non-jquery.html` behave and display what `index.html does`.
