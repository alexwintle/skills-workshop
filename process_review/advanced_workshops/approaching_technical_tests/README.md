# How to approach technical tests

**Goal:** define a plan for approaching technical tests, and other larger technical challenges.

When approaching larger problems, having a plan can help to reduce stress and increase the chances of getting to a great solution.

We'll work through preparing to tackle a larger technical challenge together, and create a plan for approach any technical challenge.

Example tech technical test: https://github.com/guardian/coding-exercises/tree/master/fruit-machine

## Questions:

1. What different types of technical tests might you encounter?

2. How might the type of technical test change how you prepare?
