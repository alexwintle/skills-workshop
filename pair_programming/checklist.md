### 1. Check in and get comfortable

Answer the following questions to set yourselves up for happiness and productivity.

- How are you each feeling today?
- What are your pairing pet hates?
- Where would you like to work?
- What physical set up will you use?
- Are you both sitting comfortably?
- How will you minimise the chance of distraction?
  - Phone silent?
  - Inbox tab closed?
  - Slack notifications off?

### 2. Discuss what you'd each like to get out of the session

- What would you each like to learn or practice?
- Is there anything that you'd like specific feedback on at the end?

### 3. Plan your cycles

- Which pairing style will you use?
- Will you use the Pomodoro pattern?  Is it applicable?
  - Code for 25 minutes.
  - Take a 5 minute break and reflect on your work.
  - Switch roles.
  - Take a longer break after every 4th Pomodoro.
- What time will you stop for lunch?

### 4. Maintain engagement

#### When navigating...
- Ask lots of questions.
- If you start to feel disengaged, be honest about that.

#### When driving...
- Explain what you’re doing and why.
- Err on the side of over-communication.
- Go at a pace that the navigator can follow.
- If you think the navigator has become disengaged, ask them some questions to get them involved or suggest taking a break.

#### Together...
- Try to keep each other engaged.
- Keep checking in with each other.
- Be ready to move away from the keyboard and diagram, whenever that might help.

> Pair programming is only of any benefit if you're both fully engaged.

### 5. Reflect

Spend a few minutes after your session reflecting on the experience.

- Did you each achieve your personal goals?
- What was the best thing about this session?
- What could you have done better?
- How could the next session be 1% better?

#### Possible areas for improvement

- Focus: did distractions sneak in?
- Communication: were there long stretches of no talking?
- Pacing / scope: did the session feel like a grind at any point?
- Division of responsibility: did you split the work up well?
- Code quality: was your end-product high-quality?
- Learning: did you both learn something?
