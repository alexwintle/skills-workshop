# Isolating units with mocks

## Learning objectives

* Remember that unit tests mock all units except the unit under test.
* Explain how to mock a unit that collaborates with the unit under test.
* Create tests that mock collaborator units.

## Task

* The code for this task is working correctly.  It's in `src/`.

* There are 6 tests in the `spec/` directory.  Each test has a description, but no test code.  Your job is to fill in test code that matches the description.

* Start with the tests in `spec/gallery-view-spec.js`.  Once you have written then, work on the (more complex) tests in `spec/gallery-controller-spec.js`.
