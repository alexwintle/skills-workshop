# Using Classes

In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of using Classes.

##### By the end of this session, all developers can...

- Explain what a class is
- Explain why a class is useful
- Define a simple class
- Create an instance of a class
- Explain the difference between a class and an instance of a class
- Explain how SRP applies to classes

## Exercises

1. Build Calculator class with some basic methods and create some instances to play with
2. Add the option to instantiate with an argument (when the argument is passed as an instance variable, we call this **state**, you can think of state as an attribute that we are giving to the class), for example...

```
calc = Calculator.new('Fred')
calc.add(1,1) => "The answer is 2, Fred"
```

3. Create a Robot class. Give it the following 4 pieces of state and make sure that it can be instantiated with this state (just like in the example above): 

- A name
- An age 
- A colour
- A signature phrase that it likes to say - or even a joke, if you're feeling fancy!
