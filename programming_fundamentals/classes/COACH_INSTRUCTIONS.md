# Classes

## Prerequisite knowledge

You might need to demonstrate these things..
- Basics of scope (method variables vs instance variables. A brief mention of how we can expose instance variables for other classes to use. Plus, why we need to create an instance of a class to be able to call a method on it). 


## Intro (20 mins)
##### Depending on where the group is at, you may wish to do an intro that touches on...
- What a class is
- Why they are useful
- Defining a class
- Instantiation
- The `initialize` method
- Adding state
## Main (20 mins)

Developers do the exercises listed in the readme

## Plenary (20 mins)

- Ask learners to share their solutions or ask them to guide you towards the solution.
- Refer back to the learning objectives and ask learners to indicate how they feel about each one, using their thumbs.
