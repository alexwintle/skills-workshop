# Using Methods

In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of how to use Methods.

## Learning outcomes

##### By the end of this session, all developers can...
- Explain what a method is
- Explain why we use methods
- Able to define some methods
- Explain what SRP is and why we use it

## Exercises
1. Define the following methods for a calculator:
    - Add
    - Subtract
    - Divide 
    - Multiply
    - Define a method called “run” which calls two of the methods above and outputs a number. 
2. Create a new file and fix the greet method (see below) so that it doesn’t violate SRP.
3. Define a new method that calls two methods from the file above.

```ruby
def greet
  # greets a user
  # asks the user what their name is, takes their name and then says "user_name, it's lovely to meet you!"	
  # tells the user the weather today - the weather should be randomly chosen and there should be 3 options 
  # Tells a user the time now
end
```
