# Using Hashes

In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of how to use Hashes.

## Learning outcomes

##### By the end of this session, all developers can...
 - Describe the basic structure of a hash using the terms 'key' and 'value'
 - Explain one scenario in which a hash might be preferable to an array
 - Add key-value pairs to a hash
 - Read a specific value from a hash
 - Change a specific value
 - Iterate over the key-value pairs, using a method which takes a block

## Exercises
 1. Create a program that
    - prompts the user for details about their favourite animal
    - stores the details as values, assigned to appropriate keys
    - prints the hash once the interrogation has finished
 2. Create a program that
    - prints all the keys in a hash
    - prompts the user to select a key
    - returns the value associated with that key
 3. Iterate over a hash and print only the values that begin with 'S'
 4. Look at the [docs][ruby_docs] for hashes and play with an interesting method
